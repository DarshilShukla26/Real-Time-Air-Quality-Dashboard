# Real-Time-Air-Quality-Dashboard
Hands on Esp32 DEVKIT-V1, NEO-6M GPS Sensor, BME688 Sensor, PMS Sensor.
Coding using Arduino-IDE.
Received the developed code for BME and PMS, were tasked to incorporate NEO-6M, database and render it on a dashboard.

SENSORS AND MICROCONTROLLERS USED:
1) Esp32 DEVKIT-V1;
ESP32 is a series of low-cost, low-power system on a chip microcontrollers with integrated Wi-Fi.

2) BME688;
The BME688 has temperature, barometric pressure, air humidity, altitude and gas sensor elements inside. All sensor information can be used either as single values or combined in the AI software to recognize certain conditions or states.

3) PMS(Particulate Matter Sensor);
A particulate matter (PM) sensor measures the concentration of floating particles in the air. PM sensors can be laser-based, and work by using a laser to illuminate a particle and then collecting the light that scatters. The sensor can then count the particles in the air, and provide real-time information  on air pollution.
